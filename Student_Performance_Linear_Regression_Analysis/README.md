</p>

## 🛠️ Description

This open-source Python project performs **student performance analysis** using **Linear Regression**.  
It aims to **predict student scores or academic outcomes** based on input features such as **study hours**, **attendance**, or **other performance metrics**.  

It’s a beginner-friendly project to understand how **machine learning models**—especially regression algorithms—can be used to analyze real-world data and make predictions.  

You can:
1. Explore the dataset and visualize student performance trends.
2. Train a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
3. Evaluate and visualize the model’s performance with error metrics and prediction plots.

Feel free to modify, improve, or expand this project as you wish!

## 📘 Dataset Information

The dataset contains information related to student learning and outcomes.  
Example columns may include:
- **Hours Studied** – number of hours a student studied.  
- **Previous Scores** – marks from past tests or exams.  
- **Attendance (%)** – percentage of classes attended.  
- **Final Score / Performance** – target variable to predict.  

The dataset can be customized or replaced with any CSV containing similar features.
